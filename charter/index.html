            <p><strong>DRAFT</strong></p>
            <p>This is a <em>draft</em> text, under development by the community. The goal is to, eventually, submit this draft charter proposal to an official W3C AC review.</p>
            <p>Any text rendered like <span class=issue>this</span> refers to content that must be finalized before the charter is sent to AC review.</p>

            Cloud services in use on the Web today (2023) often require users to store their data and place control over that data at a third-party cloud provider. Solid adds to existing Web standards to enable user control: to realise a space where individuals can maintain their autonomy, control their data and privacy, and choose applications and services to fulfil their needs. Solid defines the notion of Pods, in which users place their own data and control access to that data, and a suite of interoperable protocols for managing Pods, applications that use pods, and interactions with existing protocols for authentication.

            Solid presents several advantages over more traditional architectures for data use by Web services today, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Solid Pods are controlled by individuals or organizations, not third parties.
            </li>
            <li>
                Solid Pods enable fine-grained control over private data on a per-application and per-principal basis. </li>
            <li>
                Solid Pods enable interoperability and data sharing between applications and services while respecting user wishes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Solid Pods enable portability of data, of hosting, and of applications.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <p>
                The design approach for the Solid specification will continue substantial efforts undertaken previously in the Solid community to specify a set of interoperable protocol standards for enabling the use and development of Solid Pods and applications across a wide range of use cases.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Working Group will:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Define a core protocol specification for the secure and efficient operation of Solid servers and the behavior of clients interacting with those servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recommend a data and protocol model for interoperability between multiple applications built upon Solid.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recommend a set of practices needed for data security for Solid Pods, and for both server and client software, including use of appropriate authentication, authorization, verification, identity, and other standards, integrating existing outside efforts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recommend a set of protocol behaviors and best practices for the use in Solid of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) / Federation identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recommend a set of protocol behaviors and best practices to request and grant access to data stored in Solid Pods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Define a protocol for state synchronization regarding changes to resources in Solid pods.

                <p>
                    The Solid Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt id="protocol" class="spec">Solid Protocol v1.0</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            The Solid Protocol specification aims to provide applications with secure and permissioned access to externally stored data in an interoperable way. An overarching design goal of the Solid ecosystem is to be evolvable and to provide fundamental affordances for decentralised Web applications for information exchange in a way that is secure and privacy respecting. In this environment, actors allocate identifiers for their content, shape and store data where they have access to, set access control policies, and use preferred applications and services to achieve them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When possible, the Solid Protocol will evolve while maintaining a high degree of compatibility with existing implementations, of both servers and clients, and with features from prior versions. If incompatible changes have to be made, then they will be done by introducing a stage where both old and new protocols are supported, to allow the implementors to upgrade their systems in a managed way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Solid Protocol may include protocol details for integration with the following:

                To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have
 6 or more active participants for its duration, including 
representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and 
active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, 
specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of
 a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum 
requirement for other Participants.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group encourages questions, comments and issues on 
its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                W3C Members are invited to <a class="todo" href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/#####/join">join this Working Group</a>.

                Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>:
 the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will 
be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue 
tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written
 to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of 
specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit 
direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not 
open to public participation, however.
            </p>
            <p>
                Information about the group (including details about 
deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will

            <p>
                Most Working Group 
teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, 
and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a class="todo" id="public-name" href="mailto:public-solid-wg@w3.org">public-solid-wg@w3.org (LINK TBD)</a> ( <a class="todo" href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-solid-wg/">archive (LINK TBD)</a>) or on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/solid-wg/">GitHub issues (LINK TBD)</a>

The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.

            <h2>
                Decision Policy
            </h2>
            <p>
                This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>).
 Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, 
which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other 
reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being 
required.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress,
 but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range 
of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a 
decision along with any objections.
            </p>
            <p>
                To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational 
deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a
 face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
            </p>
            <p>
                A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all 
resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a 
response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the 
chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the 
end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have 
consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
            </p>
            <p>
                All decisions made by the group should be considered 
resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless 
reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
            </p>
            <p>
                This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
